//! Legacy utility functions - most functionality has been moved to specialized modules
//!
//! This module is kept minimal for backward compatibility. New code should use:
//! - `metadata` module for NetCDF inspection functions
//! - `statistics` module for statistical computations
//! - `netcdf_io` module for file I/O operations
//! - `parallel` module for parallel processing configuration

// This module is now minimal and serves mainly for backward compatibility
// Most functions have been moved to their respective domain-specific modules
